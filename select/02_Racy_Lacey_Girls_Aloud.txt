I know this girl she's not too bright
But she's educated in bed all right
She's made seduction a work of art
A PhD with her legs apart
She's got dreamy eyes, Lolita lips
She's got undulating, grundulating, grinding hips
She clicks her fingers, guys come to heel
Chewed up, spat out, no big deal
Racy Lacey, boudoir beauty
It's all that she can do
A connoisseur of satin sheets
A bed head through and through
Racy Lacey, boudoir beauty
The lifestyle suits her fine
The girl ain't backward in coming forward
She's got this crazy life
And so this girl I've heard it said
Can spend up to twenty four hours in bed
She gets her suiters to wait in line
And she's worn them out by half past nine
She's got dreamy eyes, Lolita lips
She's got undulating, grundulating, grinding hips
She clicks her fingers, guys come to heel
Chewed up, spat out, no big deal
Racy Lacey, boudoir beauty
It's all that she can do
A connoisseur of satin sheets
A bed head through and through
Racy Lacey, boudoir beauty
The lifestyle suits her fine
The girl ain't backward in coming forward
She's got this crazy life
She's got dreamy eyes, Lolita lips
She's got undulating, grundulating, grinding hips
She clicks her fingers, guys come to heel
Chewed up, spat out, no big deal
Racy Lacey, boudoir beauty
It's all that she can do
A connoisseur of satin sheets
A bed head through and through
Racy Lacey, boudoir beauty
The lifestyle suits her fine
The girl ain't backward in coming forward
She's got this crazy life
