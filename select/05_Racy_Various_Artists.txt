Look at me, I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, just holdin' your hand
Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty, the moment you're near

You can't see that you're leadin' me on?
But is just what I want you to do
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm followin' you

On my own
When I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowin' my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, and too much in love
I'm just too misty, and too much in love
